# CovidTracker

This project focuses on the the main parts of the Coronavirus data. It has multiple API calls from https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc#27454960-ea1c-4b91-a0b6-0468bb4e6712

It was made using Angular and Sass. Wanted to build a webapp from the ground up based on info from API calls.
